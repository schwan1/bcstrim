SUBJECT: FCOM QRH content issue

DESCRIPTION:
 =====================
Good day, dear collegues/
At least in last two FCOM & QRH revisions (9 & 10) we encounter content issure. Just some of them:
FCOM 1.  Auto flight chapter points difference in some placies between PW852, PW853, PW856, but configuration is the same. 2. Engines, APU & Fuel chapter: aii fleet equipped with one type APU, but reflection in FCOM different. We have no fuel used as well as quantity indications in LBS. All fleet with Auto Shutoff Service bulletin 737-28A1216 incorporated. 3. Secondarry landing gear indicators are installed under the same STC, but in FCOM & QRH reflected as different. FMC reflected as different soft and logic. Why?

DESIRED ACTION:
======================
Please correct content, advise route cause and if any assistance required.
