Hi, Noel,

Could you kindly investigate Korean Air's questions on OMB-59 and OMB-42?

Q1. Please review B737 FCOM OMB KAL-59(B5) and cancel if appropriate..

Q2. Is Service Letter /Ref B/ enough to remove OMB KAL-42(B5)?

Q3. If answer is "NO", is there a way to delete this? Or Is this bulletin continuously remaining until operating B737 with Honeywell Weather Radar?

/A/ B737 FCOM OMB KAL-42(B5) (attached)

DESCRIPTION:

Korean Air have questions regarding the ref /A/ and ref /C/ OMB:

Ref /C/  OMB provide recommended procedures for B737NG airplanes with at least one HG2050BC02 ADIRU installed. KAL checked the installed status and found that all of their 737NG aircraft have only P/N HG2050BC04 or P/N HG2050BC11.
See Ref /D/ and /E/ installation status for details.  Additionally, per the ref /F/ IPC the HG2050BC02 cannot be installed after removal.

So please review B737 FCOM OMB KAL-59(B5) can be canceled.


Regarding the ref /A/ OMB, Korean Air note that it was released on May 3, 2012 and this bulletin has remained for more than 5 years. The OMB noted "Honeywell has developed software modifications that should significantly reduce the occurrences of false PWS alerts. These modifications also include numerous other changes and enhancements. Service Letters 737-SL-34-188 and 737-SL-34-189 provide additional information about these changes.

Korean Air checked that those SL was accomplished or not in KAL's ERP system, and found 737-SL-34-188 was completed for B737 with Honeywell Weather Radar.


REQUIRED ACTION:

1. Please review B737 FCOM OMB KAL-59(B5) and cancel if appropriate..

2. Is Service Letter /Ref B/ enough to remove OMB KAL-42(B5)?

3. If answer is "NO", is there a way to delete this? Or Is this bulletin continuously remaining until operating B737 with Honeywell Weather Radar?
