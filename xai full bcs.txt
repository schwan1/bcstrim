DESCRIPTION:
Dear Sir/Madam:
The photo our pilot took about Integrated Standby Flight Display
is attached below.
It was taken on 737NG and the Serial Number (SN) of the aircraft
is B-1709.
We also find that Xiamen Air's 737NG and 737MAX share the same
Integrated Standby Flight Display.
Could you check that please?

RESPONSE:
Dear Joanna Lin,
Xiamen Airlines has not selected the "Filled Cue" option for
your Integrated Standby Flight Display on the 737 MAX aircraft,
therefore your 737 MAX FCOM reflects the baseline option of
"Split-Axis".
If attachments are referred to, and are not present, please
access them by logging into MyBoeingFleet Service Requests
application or contact your Boeing Field Service Representative.
